A roundup of all the news coming out of Games Workshop about the new edition: Embergard.

## The highlights

* It's called Embergard!
* Completely new format - all old cards and boards are no longer usable
* 2 warbands in the new starter set
  * The Emberwatch (Stormcast)
  * Zikkit's Tunnelpack (Skaven)
* 4 Rivals decks in the new starter set
  * Blazing Assault
  * Emberstone Sentinels
  * Countdown to Cataclysm
  * Pillage & Plunder
* 2 warbands following shortly after
  * The Jaws of Itzl (Lizardmen)
  * Grandfather's Gardeners (Nurgle daemons)
* And 2 Rivals decks
  * ???
* Warscroll cards with additional special abilities for each warband
* No faction decks
* Named playstyles (Strike, Take and Hold, Flex, and Mastery)
* 16 existing warbands will have card released at launch (see below)
* All other existing warbands will have a digital release, with many having a physical release as well
* Nemesis deck building still exists, combining 2 universal Rivals decks
* At least 3 more warbands coming with Rivals decks in 2025
* Quarterly balance updates (presumably in the form of FAQ and Errata documents)
* Organised play will feature 33 warbands at launch (the 4 brand new warbands, 16 re-released, and the 13 most recently released other warbands)

## Rules changes

* 1 board instead of 2 placed separately (no more long-boards, hooray!)
* `Underdog` keyword - the player that has the least glory
* Objectives are now called `Treasure` tokens
* `Critical successes` are just normal successes now, but if the dice roll is a success overall they trigger Crit abilities
* Fighters have a `Bounty` printed on their card instead of a flat single glory
* `Focus` core action: Discard any number of cards in your hand, draw that many cards plus another power card
* New Critical effects
  * `Overrun`: After an attack, Push the attacker 1 hex into the hex the defender was in
  * `Stand Fast`: The attack has -1 damage and the target cannot be driven back
* Upgrades now have a cost printed on their cards - they don't all cost 1 glory now
* It looks like glory isn't "spent", but rather you can't have upgrades on your fighter with costs adding up to more than your glory total.   Upgrades are removed from fighters when they're killed
* `Brutal` keyword - support symbols do not count as successes in defence rolls
* `Grapple` keyword - Push a target 1 hex instead of driving back
* `Flanked` and `Surrounded` keywords - the new names for single and double supports
* `Melee` and `Ranged` attacks - symbols next to attack actions show what type of attack it is, presumably Melee attacks will mostly be ranged 1


## Re-released warbands

As mentioned, 16 existing warbands will be re-released with models and cards, available in 4 Grand Alliance boxes with 4 warbands in each, or as just the cards in the Warbands of Embergard box.
