A rundown of all the cards that have been previewed ahead of the release of Embergard.

Remember, we're getting 4 new Rivals decks in the starter set, plus an extra 2 Rivals decks shortly after.

## Blazing Assault
The Strike deck in the starter set - in old money, that's aggro.  The cards we've seen so far are mostly re-prints of
cards we've seen previously.

#### Determined Effort (Gambit, Reaction)
The new version comes with a few changes though - you get +2 dice if
you're the `underdog`. It also seems to be a _reaction_ now instead of a gambit to play in the preceding power step,
allowing for more shenanigans than before.

#### Sidestep (Gambit)
This one hasn't changed a bit.  Push a friendly fighter 1 hex.

#### Lure of Battle (Gambit)
Nice little 1 hex push to bring another fighter adjacent to a friendly fighter, great setup to attack in the next
activation without a Charge.

#### Illusory Fighter (Gambit)
Same as old - remove your fighter and place them in friendly territory.

#### Wings of War (Gambit, Reaction)
We've seen this one before in the form of Spectral Wings.  I'm not 100% sure if this will work for a Charge action,
will need to see the wording on the rules for that.  This card says "... when you pick a fighter to Move ..." which
might transpire to be a Move action only.

#### Twist the Knife (Gambit, Reaction)
Gives an attack with a melee weapon Grievous now (which we assume is +1 damage on a critical success).

|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

#### Keen Eye (Upgrade, cost: 2)
I'm sure we've seen this card before with a different name (Hunter's Talisman, Augmented Limbs, etc), but it's had a
tweak to its wording - "melee" weapons are mentioned, perhaps that's a keyword we'll see that means "has a range of 1".

#### Duellist (Upgrade, cost: 1)
Previously known as Duellist's Speed, the reaction how has a name: Footwork.

#### Great Fortitude (Upgrade, cost: 2)
Now called Health, the fighter with this upgrade gets +1.

#### Accurate (Upgrade, cost: 1)
A solid classic with a new name - re-roll an attack dice.

#### Sharpened Points (Upgrade, cost: 1)
Gives your fighter `Cleave`.

#### Tough (Upgrade, cost: 2)
Caps damage received at 3 per _turn_.  Whether _turn_ means a whole Action Phase, or just an Action Step, will remain
to be seen for a bit longer.

|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

#### Branching Fate (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
The same as before, except comes with a nice bonus if you're the underdog - you can score it off rolling 2 dice instead of 3.

#### Strike the Head (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
I can't quite place where this has been before, but it's got 2 nice scoring conditions - kill the enemy leader, or kill
something with at least the same Health characteristic.   I feel like that should be an easy score in many situations.

#### Get Stuck In (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
The kind of objective I can really get behind - make an attack against an enemy in their own territory.  Doesn't have
to be successful, or anything else, just do the thing and make some glory.

#### Annihilation (Objective, 5 glory)
Surprised to see this one back, it wasn't seen too often in the past.

#### Perfect Strike (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score if all dice rolled for an Attack were successes.

#### Denial (Objective, 1 glory)
Bit of a change for this old friend - score in any end phase if there are no enemies in friendly territory.
Appropriately reduced to score you a single glory too.

#### Keep Choppin' (Objective, 1 glory)
Another slight change from the previous version - 1 glory in return for 3 attacks made.

#### Strong Start (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Same as old - make the first kill of a battle round.

#### Fields of Blood (Objective, 1 glory)
Score if 4 or more fighters are damaged or dead.  Nice late-game objective, but not a lot of glory!

#### Critical Effort (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score when making an attack having a crit in the roll (doesn't say anything about needing to be a successful attack).

#### On The Edge (Objective, 1 glory)
Score in an end phase if there is a Vulnerable enemy fighter.  Vulnerable being a fighter with 1 health left.

#### Go All Out (Objective, 1 glory)
Score if 5 or more fighters have Move or Charge tokens.  Potentially a good early game objective, but could be difficult
as fighters start to die off.

## Emberstone Sentinels
A Take and Hold deck (capturing objectives).  Some new cards previewed here, which is nice.

#### Switch Things Up (Gambit)
Swap the position of 2 objectives.  Nice if you've got "hold objective X" in hand but that objective is miles away.

#### The Extra Mile (Gambit, Reaction)
A nice bonus to get a fighter onto an objective, pushing them an extra hex _if_ it would land them on a treasure token.

#### By the Numbers (Gambit)
A nice bit of card draw is always welcome, drawing the number of treasure tokens you hold is great.  Potentially up to
5 cards drawn! Clearly a pipe-dream for that many, but 2 should be a reasonable expectation if you're looking to hold
them anyway.

#### Settle In (Gambit)
Give a fighter on a feature token a guard token.

#### Healing Potion (Gambit)
Heals for 1, unless you're the Underdog in which case you can roll a dice for the chance of a second heal.

|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

#### Great Speed (Upgrade, cost: 0)
A FREE upgrade!   Exactly the same as the previous version - +1 speed.

#### Brute Momentum (Upgrade, cost: 1)
Helping to keep your fighters on objectives, provided you charged to get there.

#### Hold the Line (Gambit)
Fighters cannot be driven back in the next Action step.

#### Agile (Upgrade, cost: 2)
Allows you to re-roll 1 defence dice.

#### Inviolate (Upgrade, cost: 1)
While this fighter is holding a treasure token, they cannot be Flanked or Surrounded.

#### Stubborn to the End (Upgrade, cost: 1)
Stops an attacker using the Overrun ability.  Feels fairly niche at best, but time will tell.

| ![Great Speed](/cards/preview-great-speed.jpg) | ![Brute Momentum](/cards/preview-brute-momentum.jpg) |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|

#### Careful Advance (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
A nice "get into enemy territory" bonus, but I suspect it'll be harder to score than expected due to the requirement
of needing Move tokens, not Move or Charge.  You'll score this after moving your 2nd fighter into enemy territory
when 1 other friendly fighter has already moved into enemy territory.  That means 2 activations with no attacks!

#### Iron Grasp
A re-print of a card I used to love - hold all objectives in a friendly or enemy territory.   If you can find a way
to move or remove a token, this could be as easy as holding 1 treasure token.

### Hold Treasure Token 3 or 4 (Objective, 1 glory)
As expected, hold objective X is here waiting for Switch Things Up to bring them closer.

#### Step by Step (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
A bit wordy, but the gist of this one is scoring after your opponent's Action step if you have a friendly fighter on
a treasure token in enemy territory with a Move token.  If you're the underdog, that Move token can be a Charge token.

#### Unassailable (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score immediately after being attacked when holding a treasure token.

#### Aggressive Defender (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score for making an attack whilst holding on a treasure token.  Nice.

#### Sally Forth (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score after an opponents Action step if a friendly fighter with a Charge token holds a treasure token.  Bit of a
mouthful but should be fairly easy to score.

|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|

## Countdown to Cataclysm
A Mastery deck (full of tricks, by the sounds of it), includes a Plot card that affects a Cataclysm value.

#### Growing Concerns (Gambit)
Reducing the speed of enemies based on your Cataclysm value.  Will be a minimum of -1 move.

#### Sunder the Realm (Gambit)
Potentially dish out damage to fighters near the centre of the board (within 1 hex), getting more reliable with your
Cataclysm value.

| ![Growing Concerns](/cards/preview-growing-concerns.jpg) | ![Sundering The Realm](/cards/preview-sunder-the-realm.jpg) |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

#### Bringer of Doom (Upgrade, cost: 1)
An interesting upgrade, advancing the Cataclysm tracker when the owner dies (or finds a way to discard the upgrade
another way).

#### The End is Nigh (Gambit)
This has shenanigans written all over it. After each Action step, dice are rolled and cards may be discarded. It stops
working once the Cataclysm tracker is advanced, so I expect that'll be a choice to make along the way.

| ![Bringer of Doom](/cards/preview-bringer-of-doom.jpg) | ![The End is Nigh](/cards/preview-the-end-is-nigh.jpg) |
|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

#### Collateral Damage (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score for having a friendly fighter die, or if you're losing, score for advancing your Cataclysm tracker for any reason.

#### Too Close for Comfort (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
A blessing and a curse, this is scored after your opponent's turn if your fighters are near theirs.  This means you'll
have less control over scoring it, but it could mean your opponent obliges by charging a fighter in close for you.

#### Spread Havoc (Objective, variable glory)
A nice shift of ideas for objectives - you score an amount equal to your Cataclysm value, up to 2.  Realistically that
means it's worth 1 glory early doors, then 2 later on.

| ![Collateral Damage](/cards/preview-collateral-damage.jpg) | ![Too Close for Comfort](/cards/preview-too-close-for-comfort.jpg) | ![Spread Havoc](/cards/preview-spread-havoc.jpg) |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

## Pillage and Plunder
The Flex deck in the starter set, a mixture of the other styles so expect some fighting, some holding objectives, and
some shenanigans.  The general theme of this deck seems to be about flipping treasure tokens (they're still cover hexes
on the other side).

#### Explosive Charges (Gambit)
A nice Domain effect for +1 move when charging.

#### Frenzy of Greed (Upgrade, cost: 2)
Decent defensive boost - ignoring the effects of Cleave and Ensare whilst on a treasure or stagger hex.  Also stops the
fighter from receiving Stagger tokens.  Remains to be seen if there's enough Cleave, Ensnare or Stagger around to make
this worthwhile.

| ![Explosive Charges](/cards/preview-explosive-charges.jpg) | ![Frenzy of Greed](/cards/preview-frenzy-of-greed.jpg) |
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

#### Desolate Homeland (Objective, 1 glory)
Score for having 1 or less treasure tokens in your territory, removed presumably by Delving or through other Gambits.
Combines nicely with Iron Grasp when playing the Nemesis format.

#### Claim the Prize (Objective, 1 glory, Surge)
Score for Delving, which seems to be the point of this deck.  Nice bonus that when you're the Underdog, your Delve can
be in friendly territory.  Again, combines nicely with Desolate Homeland and Iron Grasp.

#### Strip the Realm (Objective, 3 glory)
Time will tell if this is easy or hard to score - the 2 conditions gives you a better chance but both could be tricky.
Delve or remove all 5 treasure tokens (easy if your opponent is helping), or have no enemies on treasure tokens
(also easy if your opponent is helping).   Could be worth holding on to for a late-game score when there are not many
enemies left.

#### Supremacy (Objective, 3 glory)
A slight change on the old version - you only need 2 fighters to be holding treasure tokens, but their combined Bounty
must add up to 3 or more.  I imagine most warbands will have a fighter worth 2 glory, so provided they are used for
this, it's always just 2 fighters needed.
